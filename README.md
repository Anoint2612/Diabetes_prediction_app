## Features
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, allowing for a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The app uses machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes based on input features.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Hosted via **Anaconda** and optimized for quick predictions.

## How to Run Locally
To run the app locally, you can follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-web-app.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-web-app
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   conda create --name diabetes-prediction python=3.x
   conda activate diabetes-prediction
3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Diabetes_prediction(Web_App).py
The app will run locally at **http://localhost:8501/**.

**Technologies Used** <br>
**Python**: Core programming language for building the app.
**Streamlit**: Used for developing the interactive front end of the web app.
**Scikit-learn**: Employed for the machine learning model.
**Pandas and NumPy**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.

**Model Details** 
<br>
The app uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing various health indicators like blood pressure, insulin levels, age, BMI, etc., to predict whether a person has diabetes.

**Hosting** 
<br>
The application is hosted locally using Anaconda to manage dependencies and packages, ensuring that the app runs efficiently.
